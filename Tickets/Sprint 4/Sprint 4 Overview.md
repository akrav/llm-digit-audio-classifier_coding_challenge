### **Sprint 4 Overview: Bonus Challenges & Finalization**

This sprint's purpose is to implement the optional but highly recommended bonus challenges, conduct a final end-to-end review, and prepare the project for submission. It is the final polish phase that addresses the evaluation criteria of "Creative energy" and a comprehensive "README.md."

-----

### **Major Functionality Delivered**

  * **Robustness Testing:** The system will be enhanced to handle simulated noise, demonstrating the model's performance under more realistic conditions.
  * **Live Microphone Integration:** A live interface will be implemented to test the model in real time, providing a tangible demonstration of its functionality.
  * **Final Documentation:** The project's documentation will be completed, including the final `README.md`, progress reports, and the Mermaid architecture graph.
  * **Comprehensive Final Testing:** A full regression test will be performed to ensure the entire system is stable and all components work together seamlessly.

### **Sprint Tickets**

The tickets are ordered to build upon the core functionality from previous sprints and lead to a polished, submission-ready product.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Implement Noise Simulation for Robustness Testing
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-4001
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket adds a data augmentation step to the training pipeline. The goal is to make the model more robust by training it on audio data with simulated noise.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Tool:** `audiomentations`.
  * **Implementation:** Modify the data processing script to apply a random noise transformation (e.g., `AddGaussianNoise`, `AddBackgroundNoise`) to a portion of the training data.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * The training script can successfully apply noise transformations without errors.
  * A model trained with noise shows improved performance on noisy test data compared to a model trained on clean data.

**Ticket Name:** Implement Live Microphone Integration
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-4002
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket implements a live, real-time classification system. It will capture audio from the user's microphone, preprocess it, and send it to the inference module for prediction.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Tools:** `sounddevice`, `src/inference.py`.
  * **Logic:** Create a new script, `src/live_inference.py`, that captures audio in chunks, applies the same preprocessing pipeline, and feeds it to the `predict_single_audio` function for real-time classification.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * The script correctly captures audio from the microphone and provides real-time predictions.
  * The latency is low enough for a fluid user experience.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Final Documentation and Project Review
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-4003
\<br\> **Description:** This is the final documentation ticket. The goal is to synthesize all the information from the project into a comprehensive `README.md` and ensure all project documents are up-to-date.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Update `README.md`:** Ensure it contains all required sections: project overview, technical approach, key results (accuracy, latency), and a detailed account of LLM collaboration.
  * **Update Documents:** Finalize the `Sprint-Progress.md`, `Troubleshooting.md`, and `Structure.md` documents.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * The `README.md` is complete and accurately represents the project's development journey and results.
  * All project documentation is up-to-date and accurate.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Final Code Review and Submission Preparation
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-4004
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket is for the final project cleanup and preparation for submission.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Testing:** Perform a full regression test by running all unit and integration tests one final time.
  * **Cleanup:** Check for any linting errors or code smells.
  * **Submission:** Prepare the final commit and push all code and documentation to the Git repository.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * All tests pass without errors.
  * The code is clean and well-structured.
  * The final commit is ready for the interview submission.
