Environment and secrets:
- Use .env; never commit secrets. Add placeholders to .env.example and document in README if new keys are needed.

Objective:
- Build the full dataset from FSDD: load files, extract MFCCs, pad, normalize, and assemble `(num_samples, 40, 200)` features + labels. Persist arrays if needed.
- Data Source: Use the Free Spoken Digit Dataset from Hugging Face (train/test splits): https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/free-spoken-digit-dataset/viewer/default/train?views%5B%5D=train

Constraints and style:
- Follow best practices; keep changes scoped; no secrets.

Required steps:
1) Read the ticket and acceptance criteria.
2) Implement the end-to-end pipeline in `src/data_processing.py` using previously built functions.
3) Add verification code/tests for shapes and dtypes.
4) Documentation: update ticket status, Sprint-Progress, Troubleshooting, and structure if new outputs/paths are added.
5) Testing: run `pytest -q`.

Output:
- Concise status summary, files touched, and how to run tests.

Success criteria:
- Dataset generated successfully with correct shape/dtypes; tests passing; docs updated.
