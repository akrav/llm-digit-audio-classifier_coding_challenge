Environment and secrets:
- Use .env; never commit secrets. Add placeholders to .env.example and document in README if new keys are needed.

Objective:
- Implement training script in `src/model.py`: load pre-generated data, call `model.fit()`, and save model to `models/model.h5`.

Constraints and style:
- Follow best practices; keep changes scoped; no secrets.

Required steps:
1) Read the ticket and acceptance criteria.
2) Implement training logic and model saving.
3) Manual test: run the script and verify `models/model.h5` is created.
4) Documentation: update ticket status, Sprint-Progress, Troubleshooting, structure if needed.

Output:
- Concise summary of changes and how to run the training.

Success criteria:
- Model file created successfully; docs updated.
