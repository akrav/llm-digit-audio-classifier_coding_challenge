Objective:
- Iteratively optimize the CNN to surpass 95% test accuracy on FSDD without overfitting. Use regularization, augmentation, early stopping, and proper validation.

Required steps:
1) Add/modify model options in `src/model.py` (BatchNorm, Dropout, L2, extra conv, GAP, LR schedule).
2) Create `src/train.py` or extend training entrypoint to load HF dataset via `load_fsdd_from_hf`, split train/val, and train with callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, CSVLogger). Seed deterministically.
3) Add optional training-time augmentations for audio in `src/data_processing.py` or a helper.
4) Evaluate strictly on test split; produce accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5) Save best model to `models/` and record metrics in Sprint-Progress. Keep inference latency low.

Environment:
- Use the repo venv; install extras if needed: `pip install datasets audiomentations`.

Output:
- Summary of best configuration, final metrics (train/val/test), and saved model path.

Success criteria:
- Test accuracy â‰¥ 95%; checkpoint saved; docs updated; no overfitting (reasonable generalization).
