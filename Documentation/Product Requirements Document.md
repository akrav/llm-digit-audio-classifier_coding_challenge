### **1. Introduction**

The Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) project aims to develop a lightweight, real-time audio classification system capable of accurately identifying spoken digits (0-9). The primary goal is to create a functional prototype that demonstrates core machine learning principles and adheres to the project's technical constraints, including low latency and modular code.

---

### **2. Project Scope**

The project is focused on building a minimum viable product (MVP) for spoken digit recognition. The core functionality includes:

* **Audio Input:** Accepting `.wav` audio files as input.
* **Digit Classification:** Accurately predicting the spoken digit (0-9).
* **Performance:** The model must be lightweight and provide predictions with minimal delay.

The project is not required to have a graphical user interface (GUI), a database, or a web server, unless this is done as a bonus challenge. All functionality will be command-line based.

### **3. Stakeholders**

* **Primary Stakeholder:** The technical interviewers, who will evaluate the project on its technical merit, code quality, and the developer's ability to collaborate with an LLM.
* **Secondary Stakeholders:** Potential users of the prototype, who would interact with the command-line interface to test the model's accuracy and responsiveness.

### **4. Functional Requirements**

* **F.1: Data Ingestion:** The system shall read and process audio files from the Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD).
* **F.2: Feature Extraction:** The system shall extract relevant audio features from the raw audio data. The primary feature will be **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** due to their effectiveness and efficiency for this task.
* **F.3: Model Training:** The system shall train a lightweight **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the extracted features from the training dataset.
* **F.4: Model Evaluation:** The system shall evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset and report key performance metrics, including **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**.
* **F.5: Inference:** The system shall be able to load a pre-trained model and predict the digit from a single new audio file.

---

### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **N.1: Performance (Responsiveness):** The model must provide predictions with minimal latency, ideally less than one second, from the moment the audio is input to the moment the prediction is output. **Inference time** shall be measured and reported.
* **N.2: Robustness (Bonus):** The system should demonstrate robustness to noise. This can be achieved by simulating microphone noise during training or testing. The approach must be documented.
* **N.3: Code Quality:** The code must be **clean, modular, and easy to extend**. The project structure should be logical, with separate modules for data processing, model definition, and inference.
* **N.4: LLM Collaboration:** The development process must show clear evidence of collaboration with an LLM for **prompting, debugging, and architectural reasoning**. This collaboration will be documented in the final report.

---

### **6. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC.1: Accuracy:** The final model should achieve a minimum of **85% accuracy** on the test dataset. A higher accuracy is a plus, but the focus is on the speed and simplicity of the solution.
* **AC.2: Model Size:** The trained model file size should be small enough for rapid loading and inference, ideally under 100 MB.
* **AC.3: Latency Measurement:** The system must include a function to measure and report the inference time for a single audio file.
* **AC.4: Code Documentation:** All functions and key components must be commented and well-documented.
* **AC.5: README:** The final submission must include a `README.md` file that comprehensively explains the approach, key results, and the role of the LLM.
