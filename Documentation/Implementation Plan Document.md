Yes, the previous plan can be made more detailed to align with the "sprint-based" and highly granular approach of your example. While the initial plan was sufficient for a "couple of hours" interview challenge, this revised version breaks down the implementation into more explicit, actionable steps, mirroring a professional development workflow.

### **Spoken Digit Classification: MVP Implementation Plan**

**Version:** 1.0
\<br\> **Date:** August 19, 2025
\<br\> **Author:** Gemini Code Assist

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed, two-sprint plan for developing the Spoken Digit Classification MVP. The plan emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, with the first sprint dedicated to the core data and modeling pipeline, and the second focused on evaluation, optimization, and the bonus challenges. Each sprint follows a structured process to ensure a robust and well-documented final product.

## Sprint 1: Foundational Data Pipeline & Core Model Training

**Objective:** To establish the project's technical foundation by building a robust data processing pipeline and a functional, end-to-end model training system. This sprint focuses on the core classification logic and will be the basis for all subsequent work.

### 1\. Requirements & Architecture Planning

  * **Finalize Data Ingestion API:** Define the specific functions within `src/data_processing.py` for loading the FSDD dataset. Functions will include `load_fsdd_data(data_path)` to return a list of file paths and labels, and `process_audio_file(file_path)` to handle loading and resampling.
  * **Define Feature Extraction Parameters:** Lock in the initial feature parameters: **40 MFCCs** per audio clip. This number offers a good balance between information richness and dimensionality for a lightweight model. All features will be padded/truncated to a consistent length (e.g., 200 timesteps) to fit the model's fixed input size.
  * **Architect Model Prototype:** Define the exact layers and hyperparameters for the initial 2D CNN model in `src/model.py`. The architecture will consist of a simple stack of a `Conv2D` layer, a `MaxPooling2D` layer, followed by a `Flatten` and a final `Dense` layer for classification. The `ReLU` activation will be used.

### 2\. Implementation & Parallel Testing

  * **Data Pipeline:**
      * Implement the `load_fsdd_data()` and `process_audio_file()` functions. Use `librosa.load()` to handle the raw audio.
      * Implement the `extract_features()` function using `librosa.feature.mfcc()`. This function will also handle the padding/truncation and normalization of the features.
      * **LLM Collaboration:** "Write a Python function using `librosa` that takes an audio path, extracts 40 MFCCs, and pads the resulting array to a fixed length of 200, returning the padded array and the audio duration. Add comments explaining each step."
  * **Model Training:**
      * Implement the `build_model()` function in `src/model.py` to construct the Keras CNN.
      * Implement the `train_model()` function to compile the model using `Adam` and `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` and train it.
      * Concurrently, create a basic unit test file (e.g., `test_data_processing.py`) to verify that the feature extraction function outputs arrays of the correct shape and type.

### 3\. Test Suite Finalization

  * **Unit Tests:** Complete the unit test suite for the data processing functions. The tests will check for correct output shapes, proper padding, and the number of features extracted.
  * **Integration Tests:** Write a script to perform a mini-integration test: load a single audio file, extract features, and pass them through the untrained model to ensure the input and output shapes are compatible.

### 4\. Integrations: N/A

### 5\. Regression Testing: N/A

### 6\. Documentation Finalization

  * Update the `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages.
  * Generate the initial `README.md` file, including a brief project overview and setup instructions.
  * Start drafting the "LLM Collaboration" section in the `README.md`, documenting the prompts and insights gained during this sprint.

**Key Deliverable:** A fully functional, tested script that can load the FSDD dataset, extract and normalize MFCC features, and train the CNN model. The trained model will be saved to the `models/` directory.

## Sprint 2: Evaluation, Optimization, and Bonus Challenges

**Objective:** To finalize the core functionality, implement the real-time inference module with latency measurement, and tackle the bonus challenges of noise simulation and microphone integration.

### 1\. Requirements & Architecture Planning

  * **Latency Measurement:** Define the precise methodology for measuring inference latency. This will involve using `time.perf_counter()` and a "warm-up" run before measuring the average time over a set number of inferences.
  * **Noise Simulation:** Plan the integration of `audiomentations` into the training pipeline. The strategy will be to add a step that applies a random transformation (e.g., `AddGaussianNoise`, `PitchShift`) to a percentage of the training samples.
  * **Real-time Inference:** Define the `src/inference.py` module to be a standalone script that can load a saved model and classify a new audio file from the command line.

### 2\. Implementation & Parallel Testing

  * **Inference Module:**
      * Implement the core logic in `src/inference.py` to load a saved model.
      * Write a function to perform the entire inference process on a single new audio file, including the necessary preprocessing (MFCCs, padding, normalization).
      * **LLM Collaboration:** "Given this Python function that performs an inference, add logic to accurately measure and print the total time it takes, including a warm-up run."
  * **Model Refinement:**
      * Modify the `train_model()` function from Sprint 1 to include data augmentation using `audiomentations`. This will be an optional flag that can be enabled.
      * **LLM Collaboration:** "I want to add random pitch shifting and background noise to my audio data before training. Provide the code to integrate the `audiomentations.transforms.PitchShift` and `audiomentations.transforms.AddBackgroundNoise` transforms into this training loop."
  * **Evaluation:**
      * Expand the evaluation script to generate a confusion matrix and print precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

### 3\. Test Suite Finalization

  * **End-to-End Tests:** Write a script to perform a full end-to-end test. This script will load the saved model, perform inference on a known test file, and verify that the prediction is correct.
  * **Regression Tests:** Re-run all tests from Sprint 1 to ensure that the modifications for latency measurement and data augmentation have not broken any core functionality.

### 4\. Integrations

  * This sprint involves the key integration of the data pipeline, the model, and the inference module. The `main.py` script will be created to tie all these components together, allowing a user to run the entire training and inference process from one command.

### 5\. Regression Testing

  * Perform a final, comprehensive regression test to ensure all components, including the new inference module and data augmentation logic, are working seamlessly together.

### 6\. Documentation Finalization

  * Update the `README.md` with the final results, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and a specific section on the measured inference latency.
  * Complete the "LLM Collaboration" section in the `README.md`, providing a clear narrative of the prompts and the LLM's contribution to debugging, architectural reasoning, and code generation throughout both sprints.
  * Create a separate markdown file for the Mermaid pipeline diagram.

**Key Deliverable:** A complete, well-documented, and tested solution that includes the core digit classification functionality, a working inference module with latency measurement, and the bonus noise simulation feature. The project will be ready for final submission.
