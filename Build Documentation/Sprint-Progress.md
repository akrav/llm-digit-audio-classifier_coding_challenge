### Sprint 1 Progress

- TICKET-1001 - Project Setup and Initial Folder Structure: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Created folders: src/, data/, models/, tests/
  - Added files: README.md, requirements.txt, Build Documentation/*.md
  - Added sanity tests: tests/test_structure.py

- TICKET-1002 - Data Loading and Resampling: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Implemented `src/data_processing.py::load_audio` with resampling to 8000 Hz
  - Added tests: tests/test_data_processing.py

- TICKET-1003 - MFCC Feature Extraction: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Implemented `extract_mfcc_features(audio, sr)` returning 40 MFCCs
  - Added tests asserting shape `(40, num_frames)`

- TICKET-1004 - Padding and Normalization: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Implemented `pad_features(mfcc_array, max_len)` and `normalize_features(features)`
  - Added tests for padding shape and normalization stats (~0 mean, ~1 std)

- TICKET-1005 - Full Data Pipeline & Dataset Generation: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Implemented `preprocess_audio_to_features`, `generate_dataset_from_filepaths`, and `load_fsdd_from_hf`
  - Added tests verifying dataset batch shapes

- TICKET-1006 - Initial Documentation & Progress Update: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Updated Sprint-Progress, Troubleshooting, structure, and README

### Sprint 2 Progress

- TICKET-2001 - Model Definition: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Implemented `src/model.py::build_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes)` using Keras (Torch backend)
  - Added `tests/test_model.py` verifying output shape `(None, 10)`

- TICKET-2002 - Model Training Script: Completed on 2025-08-20 15:31
  - Added `train_and_save_model` entrypoint in `src/model.py`
  - Trains on available data (local `.npy` → Hugging Face → synthetic fallback)
  - Saves artifacts: `models/model.keras`, `models/model.weights.h5`

- TICKET-2005 - Achieve 95%+ Test Accuracy with Regularized Optimization: Planned
  - Will iteratively optimize with regularization, augmentation, and proper validation
